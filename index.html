	<h2>The Introduction to the field trip</h2>
	<div class="toptext"><p>The this field is going on a tour to downtown Memphis to a web design and many other branch company called Archer Malmo. The main lobby of the area is pretty big, we were introduced to Greg who was our tour guide for the time being. The main lobby (or rather where we started) had about 10 offices, one of them were a meeting room, and the other was a lab where there was 3 desks. </p></div>

	<h2>The tour</h2>

	<div class="textbox"><P>On the tour, we mainly stayed where we started, our tour guide told us some stuff about Archer Malmo and what they do, and also what the team do. A long explanation about what he do and what others do. They have a huge whiteboard with all the projects they should be doing. Like one of them, Ian, was out and had an after project with him after his baby. We spent about 2-3 hours within the area we started. Greg, who was not prepare for us, told us about the company and how it's worked in. How they have alot of branches to do, like one department works in video/films. We went downstairs where we were introduced to the lobby of where everything is worked at. The meeting room was huge, the lobby was pretty big, and the company has so many trophies to the point they don't care about and so they just chuck it in a bin. </P></div>

	<h2>Cookout</h2>
	<p> For the ending of this trip, we went out to eat a fast food chain called Cookout. I sat with a four others, Payton, Brandon, and some other dude. I ordered some hushpuppies, fries, steak-style burger, and had some oreo milkshake. All of those are in total of $15 plus tax. We spend there for a good hour or less. We four sat at the table talking about some really relatable things, like taking a dump in school or public toilet, or how we be drinking almost a full water-bottle of water when we wake up in the middle of night. The oreo milkshake tasted nice, but one thing i didn't like was that there wasn't much crunchy with the oreos. The thing I liked about CookOut is the food, it's not too bad and not too good. Just right. The hushpuppies was really good, the crunchiness, the stuffing was really good.</p>
	
	<h2>The Future</h2>
	<p>In the future after i graduate from highschool, i plan to go to college to get a master in computer science and probably something else too. I plan and hope to be to be very diverse in many coding and web design life. As for the reason why i want to be diverse in many topic is because i get to show to because i am diverse at a lot of stuff. Also, even though I'm not a moneye grubber, it would be nice to have a good income to my name so i can support my family and kids. Also, i could do some of my own experiments with the codes i learned by myself.</p>
